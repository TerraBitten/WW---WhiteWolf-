# WW---WhiteWolf-
WhiteWolf is a more functional verison of NHT (Nebula Tools) which is my previous attempt on creating a multi-tool 

you should'nt really have any problems with running this software at it will be pretty simple just like the previous multi tool I made.
You first need to install the required dependencies to proceed to run the software

Enter this command into your terminal

./installer.sh

When all the required dependecies will be installed you can run the program itself

./run.sh
